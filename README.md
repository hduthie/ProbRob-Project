# ProbRob-Project: Planar Monocular SLAM

This project implements a full SLAM pipeline using only a monocular camera and odometry in a planar environment (SE(2) motion embedded in SE(3)). It includes:

- Landmark triangulation from 2D image correspondences
- Pose graph and projection-based Bundle Adjustment (Total Least Squares)
- Evaluation against ground truth for both trajectory and map

## üîß Requirements

- Octave (tested on version ‚â• 6)
- Standard packages (no toolboxes required)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Code

Run the main entry point:
```bash
octave main.m
